    "Ans -> Python file method close() closes the opened file. Any operation, which requires that the file be opened will raise a ValueError after the file has been closed. Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. But it is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file. This is because python delegates file operations to the operating system. When you open a file with open(), you make a system call to the operating system to locate that file on the hard drive and prepare it for reading or writing. The operating system will then return an unsigned integer called a file handle on Windows and a file descriptor on UNIX. Once you have the number associated with the file, you’re ready to do read or write operations. Whenever Python wants to read, write, or close the file, it’ll make another system call, providing the file handle number. The Python file object has a .fileno() method that you can use to find the file handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or losing data. The best defense is always to open files with a context manager."
