    "Ans -> A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating.

    " - Databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).\tNoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.\n",
    " - SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.\tNoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",

    "- SQL databases are vertically scalable.\tNoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "- SQL databases use a powerful language \"Structured Query Language\" to define and manipulate the data.\tIn NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is also called unstructured query language. It varies from database to database.\n",
    "- SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.\tNoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.\n",
    " - SQL databases are not best suited for hierarchical data storage.\tNoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    " - MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.\tMongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database"
