    "Bias refers to the difference between the expected value of the model's predictions and the true value of the target variable. In other words, bias is a measure of how much the model is systematically underestimating or overestimating the target variable. A model with high bias tends to be too simple and may not be able to capture all the relevant patterns in the data.\n",

    "Variance, on the other hand, refers to the variability of the model's predictions for different training sets. In other words, variance is a measure of how much the model's predictions vary when trained on different subsets of the data. A model with high variance tends to be too complex and may be overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff arises because increasing the complexity of the model tends to decrease bias and increase variance, while decreasing the complexity of the model tends to increase bias and decrease variance. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance in machine learning models, and finding the right balance is essential for achieving good performance on new, unseen data.\n",

It may not be able to capture all the nonlinear relationships in the data, but it is less likely to overfit the training data. A polynomial regression model with higher degree polynomial terms is a more complex model with low bias but high variance. It may be able to capture more nonlinear relationships in the data, but it is more likely to overfit the training data.\n",

    "To mitigate the bias-variance tradeoff, various techniques can be used, such as regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble methods. Regularization can be used to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. Cross-validation can be used to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data and detect overfitting. Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can be used to combine multiple models and reduce the variance"

    "\n",
    " - Using a validation set: One of the most common ways to detect overfitting and underfitting is to split the data into a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it is likely overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both the training and validation sets, it is likely underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Learning curves: Learning curves can be used to visualize the model's performance on the training and validation sets as a function of the amount of training data used. If the training and validation curves converge to a similar value, the model is likely not overfitting. If the validation curve is significantly lower than the training curve, the model is likely overfitting. If both curves are low and not improving, the model is likely underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Regularization parameter: Many machine learning algorithms have a regularization parameter that controls the complexity of the model. If the regularization parameter is too high, the model may be too simple and underfitting. If the regularization parameter is too low, the model may be too complex and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Cross-validation: Cross-validation can be used to evaluate the performance of the model on multiple subsets of the data. If the model performs well on all subsets, it is likely not overfitting. If the performance varies significantly across subsets, the model may be overfitting.\n",
