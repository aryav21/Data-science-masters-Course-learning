    "Ans -> A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching). Python streamlines the efficient utilization of resources as the threads share the same memory and data space. It also allows the concurrent appearance of multiple tasks and reduces the response time. This improves the performance.Multithreading would be the best choice if you want to fragment your tasks and operations into multiple sub-tasks and then execute them simultaneously.For example - simultaneous execution of  different instances of a function.\n",

    "Ans -> Python threading allows you to have different parts of your program run concurrently and can simplify your design. Threads are very useful in modern programming whenever a process has multiple tasks to perform independently of the others. This is particularly true when one of the tasks may block, and it is desired to allow the other tasks to proceed without blocking.\n",

    " ##### DEADLOCK \n",
    "When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock.This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task. But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1(which is acquired by T1). Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need.All these three processes would keep waiting and will never end. This is called deadlock. For example - In multithreading a Deadlocks normally occurs when a Lock is not released properly or due to problems in the design scheme of a program that does not correctly foresee all the possible deadlock conditions.\n",
    "There are a number of functions for using locks within a program. The acquire() and release() functions, for example, have the task of having the lock acquired and released. But one has to carefully release all the locks acquired by a thread otherwise deadlock occurs.To avoid these cases, the locks can been designed to work as a context manager, within a 'with' statement. With this system, the lock will still be released automatically when the block with ends. In this way we will see that it will not be necessary to call the acquire() and release() functions, but everything will be managed by the context manager.\n",
    "\n",
    " ##### RACE CONDITIONS\n",
    "When two processes are competing with each other try to access a specific asset/resource simultaneously causing data corruption.For example, if two processes/threads are trying to update a shared variable simultaneously, they cause data corruption.It is very common for the race conditions to go unnoticed during testing even after multiple tests and code reviews. But in production, there would be a lot of processes and threads working parallelly and compete for the same resources, and this problem would occur.\n",
    "This could be handled with the help of Lock mechanism as it will be possible to control the competition between the various threads, ensuring that each one of them performs its activities without the unwanted interference of the other threads.For example, each thread must receive the lock, perform read-calculate-write operations and then return the lock to the others. In this way we will have control over the correct sequence of events between the various threads eliminating the race condition."
