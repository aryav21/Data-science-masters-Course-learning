    "    a. Measures of Central Tendency: Measures of central tendency are used to describe the central or typical value of a data set. The commonly used measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. For example, the mean height of a class of students or the median income of a city's population.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Measures of Variability: Measures of variability are used to describe how spread out the data is. The commonly used measures of variability are range, variance, and standard deviation. For example, the range of scores on a test or the variance in weight of a group of people.\n",

    "    b. Non-Parametric Tests: Non-Parametric tests are used when the data does not follow a normal distribution. Examples of non-parametric tests include the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. For example, a non-parametric test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the median income of two cities.\n",
