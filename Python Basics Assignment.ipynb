    "15) Python has a private heap that stores our program’s objects and data structures. Python memory manager takes care of the    bulk of the memory management work. There are two types of memory allocation in Python, static and dynamic.The stack data structure provides static memory allocation.Statically assigned variables are permanent; this means that they must be allocated in advance and persist for the duration of the program.We cannot reuse the memory allocated in the stack memory.Therefore, memory reusability is not possible. The dynamic memory allocation uses heap data structures in its implementation and these dynamically allocated variables are not permanent and can be changed while a program is running. Additionally, allotted memory can be relinquished and reused. However, it takes longer to complete because dynamic memory allocation occurs during program execution. Furthermore, after utilizing the allocated memory, we must release it. Otherwise, problems such as memory leaks might arise.Python also uses garbage collection to release memory blocks no longer in use."
