    "Ans -> The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a commonly used probability distribution that describes the distribution of many natural phenomena in the real world. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Height: The heights of adult humans are often modeled using a normal distribution, with mean around 5'7\" and standard deviation of 2-3 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Weight: Similarly, the weight of adult humans can also be modeled using a normal distribution, with mean around 150-170 pounds and standard deviation of 20-30 pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    " - IQ scores: IQ scores are commonly modeled using a normal distribution, with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.\n",

    " - Error in measurements: In many scientific experiments and studies, measurements are subject to some level of error. The magnitude of the error can often be modeled using a normal distribution, with mean 0 and some standard deviation that depends on the precision of the measurement instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation represents the spread or width of the distribution. Specifically, the standard deviation determines how much the values in the distribution deviate from the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates a wider distribution, while a smaller standard deviation indicates a more narrow distribution. When the standard deviation is equal to zero, the normal distribution becomes a single point at the mean value. When the standard deviation is very large, the normal distribution becomes very flat, indicating that the values in the distribution are spread out over a very wide range. When the standard deviation is very small, the normal distribution becomes very tall and narrow, indicating that the values in the distribution are clustered closely around the mean."

The probability of a failure (or \"0\") is simply 1-p. The binomial distribution, on the other hand, is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. The binomial distribution has two parameters: n, which is the number of trials, and p, which is the probability of success in each trial.\n",
